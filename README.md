# BadUSB Project

## Overview

This is my BadUSB project. This repository showcases a BadUSB attack using Arduino and Python scripts. By simulating a keyboard, the Arduino executes commands to download and run a file on the target system. Please use this project responsibly and for educational purposes only. There are three main files:

1. **Arduino File**
   - File with .ino extension
   - Description: Arduino code that simulates a keyboard to open a command prompt, download and execute a file on the target system.

2. **Python File**
   - File with .py extension
   - Description: Python script that collects PC specifications and browser history. It creates a text file and an Excel files with the gathered information and sends them via email.

3. **Executable File**
   - File with .exe extension
   - Description: Executable file generated from python file. This file can be run on a Windows system to automatically collect and send PC information.
